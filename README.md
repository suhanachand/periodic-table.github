hi guys!!

To sum it up, I am a former honors chemistry student and now an AP chemistry student, which means I deal with a lot of chemical theory in reality. That being said, one of my weaknesses is misentering each element's molar mass into my calculator, which leads to a completely different answer, and I honestly hate making mistakes like that. 


I created a ptable helper that provides the molar mass and valence electrons with a simple hover over the element, and with a click of a button, generates a probable Lewis dot diagram for that specific element. 
To solve my issue, I created a tool that allows you to automatically click on the element you want to add together and the amount you need of each, enabling an automatic calculation of the molar mass for that compound. Something reliable and easy to use!

I hope you enjoy using this, as I also really need a support system like this.
